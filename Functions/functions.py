#   Why Use Functions?
#       Stay DRY - Don't Repeat yourself!
#       Clean up and prevent code duplication
#       "Abstract away" code for other users
#           Imagine if you had to rewrite the "print()" function for
#           every program you wrote
#   Function structure
#       def name_of_function():
#           #block of rannable code

#   Our first function!

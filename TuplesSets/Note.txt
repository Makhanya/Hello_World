    Objectives
        Describe, create and access turples and sets
        Use built in methods to modify sets and access values in turples
        Iterate over sets using loops and set comprehensions
        Compare and contrast sets & tuples with list & dictionaries

        What is a Tuple?
            pronounced too-pul or tupple. You decide

            An ordered collection or grouping of items

            numbers = (1,2,3,4,5)

            but its is immutable!

            Can never be changeed!

            x = (1,2,3)
            3 in x # True 
            x[0] = "change me!" #TypleError: 'tuple' onject does not support item assignment

            Tuple are faster than list

            It makes your code safer

            Valid keys in dictionary

            Some methods return then to you - like
            .items() when working with dictionaries!

            methods for tuple are only two

                count
                    Returns the number of times a value appears in a tuple:
                        x = (1,2,3,3,3)
                        x.count(3) # 3
                        x.count(1) # 1
                index
                    Return the index at which a value is found in a tuple       
                        t = (1,2,3,3,3)
                        t.index(1) # 0
                        t.index(5) #ValueError: tuple.index(x):x not in tuple
                        t.index(3) # 2 - only the first matching index is returned

    Multiple inheritance
        Penguin inherits from both Aquatic and Ambulatory, therefore
        instance of penguin can call both the walk and swim methods

        What about thet greet method for our instance of penguin?
        it is calling the Aquatic.greet() instead of Ambulatory.greet()

# 1.  First, define a list called my_stuff .  It must be be at least 4 elements long.
#     The data is completely up to you, but it must contain at least 1 string and 1 float.
# 2.  Next, define a list called nums . It should be a list containing all the numbers
#     between 1 and 99 (including 99).  Don't type this out manually! Use what we learned a
#     t the end of the previous video!

my_stuff = ["Makhanya", "Mzili", 65.5, "Male"]
num = list(range(1, 100))

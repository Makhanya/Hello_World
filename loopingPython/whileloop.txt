while loops

we can also iterate using while loops, which has a different format:
    while im_tired:
        #seek caffeine
    
while loops continue to execute while a certain condition is truthy, and will end
when they become falsy

    user_response=None
    while user_response != "please"
        user_response = input("ah ah ah, you didnt say the magic word: ")

while loops require more careful setup than for loops, since you have to specify the termination
condition manually

be careful! if the condition doesn't become false at same point, your loop will continue forever!

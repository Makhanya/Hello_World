    *Compare and constrast dictionaries and list

    Introduction

    A dictionaries

        A data structure that constists of key value pairs

        We use the keys to describe our data and the values to represent the data

        Our first dictionary

            instructor = {
                "name": "Colt",
                "owns_dog": True,
                "num_courses": 4,
                "favorite_language": "Python",
                "is_hilariious": False,
                44: "my favorite number!"
            }

            keys and values separated by a colon
            Our keys are almost always numbers or strings

            Another Way

            Another approach is to use the dict function.
            You assign values to keys by passing in keys and values separated by an =

            another_dictionary = dict(key ="value")

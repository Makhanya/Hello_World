    Objectives
        Use the * and ** operator as parameters to a function and outside of a function
        Leverage dictionary and tuple unpacking to create more flexible functions

        *args
            A special operator we can pass to functions
            Gathers remaining arguments as a tuple
            This is just a parameter - you can call it 
                whatever you want!

        **kwargs
            A special operator we can pass to functions
            Gathers remaining keyword arguments as a dictionary
            This is just parameter - you can call it whatever you want!
